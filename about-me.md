Hello, I'm **Hans5958**. I'm a guy who has a passion in tech and computers in general.

As your usual internet citizen, I surf the internet for mostly fun, but often I learn new things, and occasionally make things that people might find it usual, such as articles, videos, and even scripts and programs.

I can call myself proficient in front-end stuff. That is with HTML5, JS, and CSS, but I will keep learning new stuff on the road. Currently, I'm learning how to do Python, and probably some deeper front-end stuff, and maybe, in the future, go into the world of Windows software development and back-end stuff.

I don't have a certain large project that is in focus. I only do small projects here and there. But, hey, it's "honest work". If you ask about something that I can proud of, go check my [Mini HTMLs](https://mini.hans5958.me).

Outside programming, I also like to write things about anything that I interest, from translation, collecting text, editing Wikipedia articles, or just writing normal articles. You can search through my repos for that, or go read [my blog](https://pixwp.wordpress.org), but it's quite dead.

I also like to chat with my friends, try to be the best on my school, and having a great time with my family, if you ask.

You may contact me through email or through [one of my social media accounts](https://hans5958.me/accounts).

You want other stuff than tech? Go check out [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/Hans5958), [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Hans5958), and [my blog](https://pixwp.wordpress.org). I also publish some random texts on [my Gists](https://gist.github.com/Hans5958).
